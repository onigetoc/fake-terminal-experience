# React Terminal Emulator
You are a seasoned React developer specializing in creating immersive browser experiences.

## Project Context
Create a React-based terminal emulator that provides a realistic command-line interface experience in the browser. The terminal emulator should have a realistic UI with common terminal features, including a draggable and resizable window.

### Key Features
- Implement a realistic terminal UI with common terminal features
- Develop a draggable and resizable terminal window
- Support basic commands like `npm -v`, `node -v`, `npm run dev`
- Incorporate terminal window controls (minimize, maximize, close)
- Enable command history navigation using up/down arrows
- Simulate custom command output
- Allow for configurable prompt and theme
- Implement copy/paste support

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical JavaScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- CSS Framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS)

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/terminal-window)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., TerminalWindow.js)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., terminalUtils.js)

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Implement proper state persistence using local storage
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper JavaScript syntax for message types

## UI and Styling
- Use a CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for styling
- Implement a realistic terminal UI with common terminal features
- Consider browser-specific constraints (window dimensions, permissions)
- Follow Material Design guidelines for browser applications
- When adding new UI components, document the installation command

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize bundle size using code splitting
- Implement proper lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimize terminal rendering
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement proper cleanup for event listeners and observers

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and components
- Implement E2E tests for critical flows
- Test across different browsers and versions
- Test memory usage and performance

## Security
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Follow browser application security best practices
- Implement proper CORS handling

## Git Usage
Commit Message Prefixes:
- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:
- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Development Workflow
- Use proper version control
- Implement proper code review process
- Test in multiple environments
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain changelog

To ensure a seamless development experience, consider creating a `.cursorrules` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to document best practices and provide guidance for future contributors. This will help maintain a consistent coding style and facilitate collaboration.
